        "My name is Jesse Leung.  I'm a Chinese American software engineer based out of Tokyo, Japan.  In my career I've designed and contributed to the core systems of numerous large scale projects including matchmaking websites and iOS games.  ",

        "Outside of work, I love cycling, cooking, and playing with my poodle, Seulgi.  I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow as a software engineer.  If you have a code-y, math-y (or Rust based) project in mind, please reach out!"
