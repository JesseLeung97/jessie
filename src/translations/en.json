In my career I've contributed to a number of different projects including matchmaking apps and several iOS games.  I also enjoy learning Rust and building websites for friends and family.  Outside of work, I love cycling, cooking, and playing with my poodle, Seulgi.  I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow as a software engineer.  If you have a code-y, math-y project in mind, please reach out!"
